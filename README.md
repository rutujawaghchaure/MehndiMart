Project Idea: Mehndi Sticker Marketplace

Abstract: 

The Mehndi Sticker Marketplace aims to create a vibrant online platform that connects artists, vendors, and customers seeking unique Mehndi designs in the form of stickers. Mehndi, a traditional form of body art popular in South Asia, is widely used during celebrations, particularly weddings and festivals. However, applying Mehndi can be tedious and time-consuming, which often deters many individuals from choosing this beautiful art form. By offering readily available Mehndi stickers that can be applied quickly and easily, our marketplace simplifies the experience while allowing for creative expression. Users will have access to a wide range of designs, from traditional to contemporary, in various styles that cater to different occasions. Through an easy-to-navigate interface, customers can browse, purchase, and apply Mehndi stickers without the need for intricate skills or time commitment.

Problem Overview

Sector/Vertical Introduction

The Mehndi industry is not just a cultural tradition; it has blossomed into a multi-faceted business providing artistry, fashion, and self-expression. With increasing globalization and cross-cultural engagements, Mehndi has transcended its traditional roots to find favor in diverse populations, including Western societies. The demand for Mehndi art has fueled a robust industry encompassing professional henna artists, temporary tattoo vendors, and DIY kits for at-home use.

Despite the rich cultural significance of Mehndi, applying it can be cumbersome, requiring both talent and time. Many potential consumers hesitate to go through the process of hiring a henna artist or applying Mehndi themselves, especially when they only need it for short-term occasions. This creates a gap in the market for a convenient, user-friendly option that maintains the beauty and artistry of Mehndi without the associated hassles.

Market Coverage

The market for body art, particularly Mehndi, is expanding worldwide. As the demand grows, particularly among young consumers and those planning events such as weddings, parties, and festivals, the need for quick and aesthetically pleasing solutions increases. Our platform will not only target South Asian communities but also market to international audiences, appealing to anyone interested in temporary body art. The accessible nature of Mehndi stickers will attract consumers who may not have previously engaged with traditional Mehndi art.

Pain Points

Several challenges persist in the current Mehndi market:

Accessibility: Finding a talented henna artist can be difficult, especially in certain regions.

Time Consumption: Traditional Mehndi application requires significant time and artistry, making it less appealing.

Messy Application: The traditional method can be messy, leading to dissatisfaction with results.

Cost: Professional Mehndi application can be expensive, especially for large events.

App Prospects

The Mehndi Sticker Marketplace will provide a solution to these issues by offering an on-demand platform for purchasing Mehndi stickers that can easily be applied at home. With a focus on user experience, affordability, and aesthetic quality, the app has excellent prospects for capturing a niche market segment in the body art industry.

App Engineering

Prospective Tech Stack

The platform will utilize:

Frontend: React.js for a responsive and dynamic user interface.

Backend: Node.js with Express.js for managing server requests and business logic.

Database: MongoDB for flexible data organization and scalability.

Frontend

The user interface will be designed to promote ease of use, as illustrated in Excalidraw. Key pages will include:

Home Page: Featuring featured designs, categories, and promotions.

Gallery Page: Displays available Mehndi sticker designs, allowing users to filter by occasion, style, and price.

Purchase Page: Simple checkout process for a seamless buying experience.

Backend

The backend will handle user registrations, order processing, product sorting, and implement fraud detection systems to ensure transaction security.

Database Handling

The database will manage essential data types such as user profiles, sticker designs, order details, and reviews. The proposed schema consists of:

Users: { userId, name, email, password, address }

Stickers: { stickerId, name, designImage, category, price, artistId }

Orders: { orderId, userId, stickerId, quantity, orderDate, status }

Expected database solutions may include MongoDB Atlas or Firebase for cloud-based services.
